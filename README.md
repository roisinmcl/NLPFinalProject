`data/raw/` contains `data_stage_one` data files from the [convote dataset](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/llee/data/convote.html). They are seperated into `train/`, `test/`, and `dev/`. They are separated by speaker, and the political party of the speaker is 'P' in the name of the file: `([0-9]\_)+P\w\w.txt`, where 'R' represents the Republican party, and 'D' represents the Democratic party.
